To - Do:

Nikhil -
Fix the form fields coming up with data
Prompt engineer so the results are a little more realistic
Results demographics buttons are getting cut off
Swap password and email fields in the sign up page
Redirect to sign up rather than sign in – sign up free and add benefits
Add optional tags in brackets where stuff is not needed (eg for media field, people are looking to add files even if they don’t have anything relevant)
change the household income to
Definitely make the supporting media section easier to understand, what is it and what does it do etc
Fix the “results loading” on the results page, so you can resend the info after 20 seconds or smthn. Also just restyle it.

Engombe -
sentiment and would buy improvements
Could add tooltips to explain what each section of the form does.
Employment and history still autofills from location, so does interests and behaviours from title. Need to fix these.
Need to de register the final submit button once clicked once as well, as i noticed my users were clicking it multiple times.
Also the layout is not responsive properly, need to fix this (in the form section itself)

for later -
Probably need different form layouts for marketing and branding and the core idea etc
This is also not well understood by the user, they think it is more their employment and history rather than the user’s
The results page is not useful - Might be better to use a framework, or just highlight tips for improvement instead of giving all of the other info. Need to add in a section which describes the idea as well, as I am not even sure if it is registering the idea properly.

Step 1: Testing and Validating Your Idea (In-Depth Guide)

Your goal in this step is to gather detailed, actionable feedback from real users to refine your app before scaling. Here’s how to systematically do it:

⸻

1. Identify Your Target Users

Before testing, you need to define who you are testing with. Since your app is for market research, the best initial testers would be:
• Startup founders (they need market research to test their business ideas)
• Product managers (they validate product-market fit)
• Marketers & researchers (they conduct audience analysis)

If you aren’t sure about your audience yet, testing with a mix of people can help reveal patterns in who finds your app valuable.

2. Create a Simple User Testing Plan

Don’t just ask random people for feedback—structure it to get useful responses. 1. Set clear goals:
• Can users understand what the app does within 30 seconds?
• Do users know how to use it without explanation?
• Is the output (AI-generated insights) valuable to them?
• What features confuse them or seem unnecessary? 2. Decide on testing methods:
• Live usability tests (watch them use the app and note where they struggle)
• Survey after testing (ask structured questions to get detailed feedback)
• Short interviews (ask users to describe their experience)

⸻

3. Find Your First Testers

Since you don’t have a big user base yet, you need to manually invite people to try the app.

Where to Find Testers?
• Friends & Family: Even though they may not be your ideal users, they can point out usability issues.
• Online communities:
• Reddit: r/startups, r/marketing, r/saas
• Indie Hackers (https://www.indiehackers.com/)
• Product Hunt Makers Community
• Facebook/LinkedIn Groups (startup & marketing groups)
• Cold outreach on LinkedIn & Twitter:
• DM startup founders and product managers
• Post in groups saying you’re looking for beta testers
• Coworking spaces & incubators:
• Attend startup meetups, hackathons, or pitch nights

Template for outreach:

Hey [name], I’m working on an AI-powered market research tool that helps startups get customer feedback faster. I’d love to get your thoughts on the app—it’s free to try, and I just need 10-15 mins of your time. Would you be open to testing it and giving some feedback?

⸻

4. Run the User Tests

Once you have testers, watch them use the app in real-time.

How to do it: 1. Ask them to share their screen (on Zoom, Google Meet, etc.) 2. Give them a task: “Imagine you have a new business idea. Try to get feedback using this app.” 3. Do NOT guide them—see if they understand the interface themselves. 4. Ask them to think aloud: “Tell me what you’re thinking as you go.” 5. Note moments of confusion or frustration.

🚨 Key insights to look for:
• Do they get stuck anywhere?
• Do they ask, “What does this button do?” → Labeling issue
• Do they misunderstand how to input their idea? → UI issue
• Do they trust the AI-generated insights? → Core value issue

⸻

5. Collect Feedback Systematically

After testing, ask them structured questions:
• Clarity: What do you think this app does?
• Ease of use: What was confusing or unclear?
• Value: If this was a paid tool, would you pay for it? Why or why not?
• Missing features: What would make this more useful for you?
• Next steps: Would you recommend this to someone else?

📌 Tip: Use a Google Form or Notion doc to record responses so you can spot trends.

6. Prioritize Fixes & Improvements

You’ll get tons of feedback—but don’t try to fix everything at once. Instead: 1. Identify recurring issues (e.g., if 5+ users say something is confusing, that’s a priority) 2. Sort issues into categories:
• 🔥 Critical (blocks usage) – Must fix ASAP
• ⚠️ Important (reduces value) – Fix soon
• ✅ Nice-to-have – Can improve later
