to do:

i have the code for the demographics now. this generates a list of people which would review the item etc

the next bit is to generate the initial feedback. I have done 60% of this, but need to pass the info from the demographics into it and loop through the people in it.

the output should be:
sentiment - positive, neutral or negative, - string
does the demographic think they are a good fit for the market research - boolean
what user likes about product / service / idea - string
pain points - string
pricing insights - willingness to pay (1-10) and would buy (boolean) and reason (string)
barrier for adoption if would buy / use is false
suggested improvements - string

the results section itself should look like this:

1. Summary
   • Brief overview of key findings
   • Overall market sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) (bar graph)

2. Target Audience
   • Demographics (age, location, industry) (if i can do a map then map)
   • Customer personas (slider of each in a profile)

3. Key Insights
   • What users like (top positive feedback) (string)
   • Pain points (common complaints & areas for improvement) (bulletpoints)
   • Pricing insights (willingness to pay & perceived value) (graph of the number)

4. Adoption & Interest
   • Percentage of users likely to buy or adopt (graph?)
   • Barriers to adoption (string)

5. Recommendations
   • Suggested improvements (bulletpoints)
   • Next steps for product development & marketing (string)
