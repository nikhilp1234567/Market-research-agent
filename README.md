to do:
the route.js now has the code to make the demographic array for the product.

the next step is to build a simple function which takes the input from the form and gives a set of feedback in a structured format
this needs to be passed to the front end and shown on the screen.

the step after getting this to work is to add in the details of one hardcoded profile (same structure as the json output of the demographics)
to fine tune the model and output their feedback directly to the front end as before

after this, i need to add each of the results to arrays rather than passing directly. quantitative results will be averaged (even if there is only one) and qualitative will be pushed through another gemini to collate. these again need to be passed through;
